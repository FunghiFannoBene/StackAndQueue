You can think of the enqueue operation in a queue as a way to "flag" or mark elements that require further processing or operations. By enqueuing elements and manipulating the queue, you can keep track of which elements need to be processed or have specific operations performed on them.

Enqueuing an element into a queue adds it to the end of the queue, indicating that it requires attention or further processing. This allows you to maintain a specific order or sequence of elements that need to undergo certain operations.

You can enqueue additional information or data alongside the elements to indicate the specific operations or flags associated with each element. This information can guide the subsequent steps of your algorithm or sorting process.
